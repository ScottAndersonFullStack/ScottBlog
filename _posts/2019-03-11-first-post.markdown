Hi and welcome,

My name is Scott Anderson, and this is my first blog. The idea behind this blog is to solidify new technologies that I'm learning and also to get better at communicating the tech landscape.
I'll post projects I'm working on and updates to those. Also I'll include fun things I've learned along the way.

Thanks for stopping by.

-Scott Anderson
